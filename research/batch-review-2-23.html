<h4>How might MP1 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp1_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 2]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP1 would probably feel it's cool, she'd love to be seen as bravely facing off a couple of very old dinosaurs, MP2 and Putin, giving them a race against her horse as the edit implies.</p>

<p>MP1 would feel gratified, receiving recognition for saving the planet, facing off against MP2, who loves coal, imagines there is no such thing as global warming, and pretends the world is just fine, thanks to big oil.</p>

<p>MP1 would wonder why she has to be atop a horse, she is awkwardly placed there, the positioning is incredibly awkward and unnatural for anyone, the edit makes her seem very awkward, instead of shaking hands she holds reins.</p>

<h4>How might MP2 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp2_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 3]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP2 would wonder who MP1 is, he'd be confused and not know who she was, he pays little attention other than responding in the twitterverse about her, actually seeing her, he'd be hard pressed to understand who MP1 is.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that MP1 would frolic in any way with MP2, she would not, she probably wants nothing to do with MP2, even on horse back, shirtless, even less so.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that MP1 would really engage at all against someone like MP2 who says she should just go to the movies, the edit mistakes the fact she would engage him at all.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about MP1?<mark>[dim: mp2_mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that MP2 would look this way in real life, there is no actual way he could be hoisted atop, even a super sturdy clydesdale horse.</p>
