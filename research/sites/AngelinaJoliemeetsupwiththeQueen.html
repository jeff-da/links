 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would be intruiged because this is a very strange game to be showing in a royal house and she would likely never want to waste her time playing this when meeting with guests or performing her duties</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would be embarrassed because she would not want people to think that she spends any of her free time playing childish games with celebrities for fun</p>

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be upset because it must seem very disrespectful to be shown in an image as playing games like this when you are a guest inside of a royal palace</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be humiliated because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is being portrayed as looking very intense and determined to win a game like Rockem Sockem Robots against someone as important as 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to be playing a game because the surroundings have been changed to create a Rockem Sockem robots arena that they are both touching</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to Make 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem very silly because it looks like two people as important as 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would rather be playing a childish game instead of discussing or working on something important together</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to associate 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 with this company because 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 are being photographed in front of a very specific type of game in a manner that almost looks like 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 were posing just for this game</p>
