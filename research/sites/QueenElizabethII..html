<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel gratified, like he's finally getting his due, seeming all powerful, generally on top of everyone, riding 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 in the exact manner he does his favorite horse.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would wonder why he appears to have 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 instead of his horse, he likes the horse and looks good on it, he might wonder how this would all work out.</p>

 is shown as symbolically riding her or Great Britain, she'd dislike that idea, she'd not like to be thought of as weak, as this would make it seem with the edit, 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 riding her.</p>

<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and strong 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to show that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>

<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 the way he might a horse.</p>

<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
, how she can't do anything, she's weighted down by 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, Brexit, and a world of trouble.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to show how 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 controls 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and much more, how he's literally, as shown in the edit, at the top of his game and the world.</p>

, as represents him riding the United Kingdom is erroneous.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 actually rides an old lady, this isn't true, it's unseemly in fact and he'd not do it, though the symbolic part of it, neither is true.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is on top of the world, he does have power but  doesn't control all the world, though he does have his moments.</p>

<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is controlled by 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, it is not correct, this is an error, she has little to say to him one way or the other, contradicting the edited image of him riding her.</p>
