<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel embarrassed because it looks like some kind of circus performer has created two oversized effigies of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 and is posing with them in a mock-up of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real-life office</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be angry, because it looks like a prankster is making fun of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's appearance by putting a copy of his head onto two oversized mascots</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look foolish when he stands next to the mascots, because it looks like the mascots bear his face while he wears a mascot-like mask over his real clothes</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to suggest that the mascots were actually created by a protester, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real face has been made into oversized effigies that ludicrously grace each body</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look ridiculous, because he is seen wearing a cartoon mask, and standing between two oversized costumed-mascots who each bear a large effigy of his real face</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to suggest that a protester in 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's country created two large mascots to lampoon 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, because it looks like a masked man is demonstrating these mascots in a mock-up of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real office</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to imply that three protesters actually broke into 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's office and had their picture taken because they are physically present in the office, yet one is dressed like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 with a cartoon mask, and the others are dressed in costumes with large mock-ups of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real face on top of their shoulders</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that the Turkish President actually wanted his face to be added onto oversized cartoon mascots, because two such mascots are being unveiled in the President's office and the president himself is wearing some kind of cartoon mask at the ceremony</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that protesters created caricatures of the new Turkish mascots because it looks like someone is demonstrating two mascots that inexplicably bear oversized replicas of the president's real face over their shoulders</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that protesters broke into the president's office wearing costumes that would lampoon both the president and his country's new mascots, because three of them are seen standing in front of the president's desk with one wearing a cartoon mask and the other two are wearing replicas of the president's real face over cartoon bodies</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 commissioned a series of mascots for his country that all wear cartoonish-clothing, yet sport realistic effigies of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real face, because it looks like a man in a cartoonish mask (which could be 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 himself) is demonstrating two of these new mascots at an official ceremony in 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's office</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is being lampooned by a circus performer who has created two giant mascots that bear 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real face, because it looks like this satirist is demonstrating the mascots in an ersatz copy of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real office</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 was unaware that three protesters broke into his office and had their picture taken ridiculing 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's appearance, because one man is seen wearing a suit very similar to 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's usual attire, but with a cartoon head, and the man's two accomplices are wearing ludicrous oversized clothing with oversized effigies of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's real face on their shoulders</p>
