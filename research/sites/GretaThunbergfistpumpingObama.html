<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would probably feel it's cool, she'd love to be seen as bravely facing off a couple of very old dinosaurs, 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 and Putin, giving them a race against her horse as the edit implies.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would feel gratified, receiving recognition for saving the planet, facing off against 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
, who loves coal, imagines there is no such thing as global warming, and pretends the world is just fine, thanks to big oil.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would wonder why she has to be atop a horse, she is awkwardly placed there, the positioning is incredibly awkward and unnatural for anyone, the edit makes her seem very awkward, instead of shaking hands she holds reins.</p>

<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would wonder who 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is, he'd be confused and not know who she was, he pays little attention other than responding in the twitterverse about her, actually seeing her, he'd be hard pressed to understand who 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would wonder why she is made to appear to bow here, she wouldn't probably do this and he doesn't know who would, although he woudn't mind people of any sort grovelling or bowing to him, that's his wheelhouse.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to burnish 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
's image, showing her bravely approaching world leaders, even if, as the edit implies she might be sort of bowing.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to help draw attention to climate change, showing all these disparate characters in the edit, Greta, Trump, Putin, all polar type opposites, the edit might draw attention.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would ever be caught dead even nearing something like a bow near 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
, nope, this is an error.</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would ever appear shirtless, also a misdirect on the edit, the change implying 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 riding a horse is silly enough, also not going to occur.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is an equestrian, I don't think she is, she is a climate savior. Horses aren't her realm, the edit makes a mistake in implying that.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would frolic in any way with 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
, she would not, she probably wants nothing to do with 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
, even on horse back, shirtless, even less so.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would really engage at all against someone like 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 who says she should just go to the movies, the edit mistakes the fact she would engage him at all.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would look this way in real life, there is no actual way he could be hoisted atop, even a super sturdy clydesdale horse.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would ever agree to appear shirtless, his girth and bosom size would rival that of even a shapely model's, the edit showing him thus is mistaken.</p>
