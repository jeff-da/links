<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to hide evidence of the climate protest, as the edit tries to make the river look like it normally would.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to deny that the climate protest happened, because the river has been altered to hide the dye used in the protest.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that no climate protest took place, and the citizens of this town are a lot more apathetic about the issue than they really are, because the dye used in the protest has been hidden.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to exaggerate the effects and severity of climate change because the river seems to be completely dried up with just a canyon left where it once was.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to lampoon people who believe in climate change because the effects are so unbelievable to where an entire river could dry up leaving a canyon in so little time.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that climate change is not as severe as it might be, since the original river in Zurich was dyed green to protest the inaction on climate change, someone might see this and think people were being crazy by creating this edit.</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that climate change is extremely severe and sudden, since the entire river is gone and the edit is believable given that the canyon seems to fit right in.</p>
