<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1 (box includes George but he's not relevant, only Obama)]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1 (box includes George but he's not relevant, only Obama)]</mark>
 would feel it's funny and silly, he'd probably be amused at being pictured with George and Jerry as the edited image, with all 4 diners sharing, intimates.</p>

<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 6]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 6]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 6]</mark>
 would find it charming, he'd probably feel good about it. Seinfeld is iconic, he's probably a fan and would probably cherish the opportunity to do this in real life. The edit adds his image in George and Jerry's usual eatery in New York.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to draw similarities between Seinfeld's show about nothing (this is the theme and popular patois regarding the show) and a quaint meeting with Tradeau as a meeting about nothing, it's a sort of commentary on that theme, the edit with George and Jerry might bring that to mind.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to draw parrellels between George and Jerry's conversations being simply empty air, talking, yadda yadda, etc., and 
<mark>[person in box 1 (box includes George but he's not relevant, only Obama)]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 6]</mark>
 having a chat also about nothing really yadda yadda (I refer here to a popular saying originated by Jerry S. in his show here).</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1 (box includes George but he's not relevant, only Obama)]</mark>
 actually all ate dinner together once, they might think this is a photo of a real meeting not an edited one, as this is.</p>
