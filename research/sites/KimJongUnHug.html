<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that Kim Jong Un is the target of active assassination plots involving air strikes, and that he has ostensibly miraculously survived one such strike, because the photo shows that a bomb was once guided to Kim's location perfectly</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 was actually targeted in a military strike, because he is shown literally seconds before being struck by an airborne bomb, but the bomb must have missed its target and failed to explode, leaving 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 free to continue living his life</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 was actually killed in a military strike in recent memory and that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
s own cameramen caught his death on film, because he is shown celebrating with generals seconds before a bomb falls onto his location.  However, governments have continued to pretend that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 remains alive, most likely for their own nefarious purposes</p>
