 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel proud because it looks like he is riding a bear while wearing elaborate gold armor and holding a sword, both of which give him a very strong and virile appearance</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be confused because it looks like the bear he is riding is wearing sunglasses and a gold chain, yet the sunglasses are not being held in place by the bear's ears and the necklace appears to be hanging unconnected from the edge of the bear's face, which would not be possible due to gravity</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to be a medieval knight, because he is wearing elaborate gold armor and holding a sword while he rides on a bear</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to have magical powers, because he has not only tamed a wild bear such that he can ride on its back, but he has also somehow managed to get the wild beast to wear sunglasses and a gold necklace, neither of which appear to fit its head and face</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>

<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is dressed in this way while riding the beast</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 somehow managed to get a pair of sunglasses and a gold chain necklace to stay in place on a bear's head and face, possibly using magical powers befitting a man in 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's armor, but more likely using creative, yet cruel, use of glue and other fasteners</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 actually managed to get a bear to wear sunglasses and a gold necklace because it looks like

 is riding a bear that is wearing these accessories</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 actually rode a bear while wearing elaborate gold armor and holding a sword that both appear to have come from a video game, because

 is seen riding the bear and wearing these items in real life, even though they have a pixelated appearance that was common in many early video games</p>
