<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be upset because it looks like she is about to kill another person, and this runs contrary to her gentle nature</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look like an evil genius, because it looks like she is about to kill a man with a high-powered laser beam</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem evil and violent, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is laughingly preparing to kill a man with a laser beam</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that a female actress who in the 1960s looked surprisingly like Queen Elizabeth today, once acted alongside Sean Connery in a Bond film that had a climax similar to that of Goldfinger, because the female antagonist is shown terrorizing Connery's character with a laser beam.  This movie was so awful that the studio canceled production and made "Diamonds are Forever" instead which, by comparison, was actually pretty good</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that the current Queen Elizabeth II, contrary to her genial demeanor in public, once caught a foreign spy and took great pleasure in torturing him to death with a high-powered laser because the final moments of the man's life were captured on film</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel goofy because she originally made a devious looking face on purpose and has now been poked fun at with this face swap onto a mad scientist.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to be somewhat crazy because she is shown giving a silly face that would call to mind an old crazy person.</p>

 seem like a mockable head of state because it is implied that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is not completely sane due to the face she is making and that it fits on that of a mad scientist without seeming out of place.</p>
