 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim:

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel unsure because he may not understand what the purpose is behind making a salmon 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has caught breath out flames</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel moody since it seems ridiculous to try and make it seem like a fish could manage to do something like breath fire</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make the fish 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is holding have dragonlike qualities because breathing fire is something only a dragon could do if it were real and is being attributed to a salmon</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make fishing seem more dangerous than it is because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has a concerned look on his face as he holds a fire breathing fish</p>
