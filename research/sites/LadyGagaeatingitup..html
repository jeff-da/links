<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel grateful because the megaphone looks much better than her hands alone which 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is holding in a way that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appears to be eating something invisible from an unseen container.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be concerned because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would not remember using the megaphone and worry about over imbibing on any controlled substances that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 may have partaken of.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to emphasize 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's propensity to be outspoken because showing 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 shouting through a megaphone is a good physical way to portray 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 as being outspoken.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to draw attention to 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 being in the crowd because holding a megaphone would identify 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 as someone who demands to be heard which is a trait 

<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is well know for.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to create a dislike of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 among 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's fans and admirers because the megaphone makes 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to be pushing 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's outspokenness too far.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has changed professions and  is not a sports coach or cheerleader because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is shown shouting through a megaphone at some one or ones at what very possibly could be a sporting event.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is now a self proclaimed cheerleader because the event being filmed could very  possibly be a sporting event and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is shouting through a megaphone like cheerleaders have been know to do.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is such a pushy and demanding person that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 carries a megaphone with 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 so 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 can be sure 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is heard because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is shouting through a megaphone and is much more animated than anyone around 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
.</p>
