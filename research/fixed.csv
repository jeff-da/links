Hey. ;^)  I guess you got my email, even though you didn't respond. ;(  I dig the new bonus structure, I dig the changes to the instructions. I'd appreciate it, if you have time, to glance over my answers here, and let me know if I'm doing this correctly, so I don't give you crap data.  

A note on formatting; is it possible to expand the main content to be wider, so it uses more of one's monitor, instead of having so much gutter to each side?

Also, for all the captions, is it possible to automatically have the cursor be after the word 'make' when tabbing down?

Little things, likely inconsequential.  Especially if I'm not even doing these correctly.
