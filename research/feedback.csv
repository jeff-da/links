Shouldn't there be? There are for MP3!

Next --- For these images, it's kind of hard not to write what I know (Though, I'm chortling at calling Clinton a conservative; I dug him in the 90s; awesome times...).  But, are we supposed to? If we know someone's a politician or an
ex-President, should we put that in our narratives? Are we _supposed_ to know that? Or is it fine both ways?  (I know, I could just email you, but I'm putting here so you have context with the images.)

Speaking of the images, it's kind of redundant having with and without boxes.  It'd be more sensible to have two images, where you can toggle the boxes on or off. However! That might break what I just did, which is to drag the edited images with boxes to a side monitor, so I could continue to look at it while I type.    Shouldn't there be two original images, anyway?   It's a bit confusing because, technically, you could call both the original image, until the modification?  But this is just housekeeping; this feels more straight-forward to me now, with the same caveat of me asking you, ""Is this anywhere the hell close to what you want mate?"" :P

(Did I mention in my email it's great that you have the edit as 'generally negative' checked? But, for this picture --- this picture actually feels a lot more neutral. It's not really positive or negative, or, rather, it's either, depending on your perspective towards partying and/or if you know the people involved.  They can either be cool, or decadent...  Would it make sense to have a neutral, or does it need to be a binary choice?)
