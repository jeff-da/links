<h4>How might MP1 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp1_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 1]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP1 would love this, he loves to see himself, always speaks, almost solely of himself, and imagines he's the only important person or force in the room, a picture where he is depicted over and over is a sort of nirvana for MP1.</p>

<p>MP1 would wonder why the other persons had sort of different bodies and poses, he'd want only the best and most robust type image, he'd be curious about that, the fact that his own face replays over and over is just a sort of bonus.</p>

<p>MP1 would wonder where all the other Republican president's originally depicted went, what happened? He likes himself but wants to see himself in controlling all other Republicans, they are his minions.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark>[dim: intent]</mark></h4>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark>[dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to sort of stoke the ego of MP1, saying, see, look how great you are, you outdo everyone, you're great, you're really the very best, yes you are.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to mock MP1, he isn't great, he isn't even good, no one else should have to endure his contenance, even in a sort of oil painting cartoon portrayal.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to hold up the image of MP1 as a sort of mirror for our social conscience, pointing out how being led by an egoist, who loves his own image, is in fact, a sort of mimeograph type boring display</p>
