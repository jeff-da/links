<p>MP1 would wonder why the cat appears on his shoulder, it seems oddly placed, there isn't a mouse or anything for the cat to eat, he doesn't understand.</p>

<p>MP1 would think featuring the cat sitting on his left shoulder is cute, it literally appears to lick and lap up his beautiful thick dark hair, drawing attention to it.</p>

<p>MP1 would wonder why he was saddled with the image of a cat, showing up, sitting atop him, he'd be puzzled as to it's meaning, is he part of a weird meme thing? He doesn't know and puzzles.</p>
