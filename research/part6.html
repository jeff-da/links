<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><b><i>Step-by-step instructions (new! 2/17):</i></b></p>
<ul>
        <li>1) Before typing, think about the edit - what is the intent of the edit? Take mental note of who the main persons are - who the edit is featuring.
        <li>2) Scroll down to the questions. Answer prompt 1 (required): What physically changed in the edit? </li>
            <li>3) Answer Prompt 2, <b>Is there a main person in this image (MP1)? (It's OK if there's no main people in the image, e.g. a background change.)</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>If yes: label the box that captures MP1 by scrolling back up to the image labeled “Edit with Boxes”. If the boxes are hard to distinguish, just give your best guess and move on. We won’t penalize attempts here :)</li>
            <li>If yes: answer Prompt 2 (part 1/2). As a reminder, please write both a <span class="response">response</span> and a <span class="rationale">rationale</span> for EACH caption.</li>
            <li>For example: MP1 would <span class="response">feel like the last person in an apocalyptic world</span> <span class="rationale">due to the fire and the fact that mp1 looks dressed for the end of the world.</span></li>
            <li><span class="emph">(new! 2/19)</span> If yes: answer Prompt 2 (part 2/2) if it applies. You should talk about specifically what someone might believe about MP1 (examples in Examples). If this doesn't really apply to this main person, you can skip.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            4) Answer Prompt 3 and Prompt 4 in a similar manner (for different people).
        </li>
        <li>
            5) Answer Prompt 5 and Prompt 6, which will ask you general questions about the image. Try to refer to each MP here.
        </li>
        <li>
            6) <span class="emph">(new! 2/19)</span> Answer Prompt 7, if it applies. For this prompt, it's different from the "(part 2/2)" prompts in that you shouldn't focus on MP1/2/3, but rather, what you would generally take from the image as a whole. If there isn't anything you can be mislead by (e.g. it's just a funny edit), feel free to skip.
        </li>

            7) Submit!

        <b><i>Details:</i></b> (you do not need to read all of these! they might helpful if you get stuck :))
        <ul>
            <li>Including any world knowledge is OK. For example, it's fine to mention which of the public figures or places you recognize, and to use this infomation in your captions. The only time when we wouldn't want this is when we can use MP1/2/3 to describe a person instead. At the same time, you don't HAVE to know a public figure or location, especially if it is obscure or not obvious.</li>
            <li>It's OK if you click MP1/2/3 on accident. As long as you don't put in captions, the data won't get considered.</li>

            <li>Check out the examples! They should help with understanding what to do quickly.</li>
            <li><span class="emph">With simple edits, it's ok to be repetitive.</span> For example, if there is just one change, you can cite the same "rationale" for all captions. If the change is more complex, please try to use different captions.</li>
            <li><span class="emph">It's okay if there's no main people, e.g. a background change.</span> You can still answer the last two questions.</li>
            <li>Do not refer explicitly to the images in your caption (e.g. saying “the image edit”, “the original edit”). The captions should make sense without needing to look at the images.</li>
            <li>Your captions between Prompts might be similar. This is ok! The only criteria is that it answers the related question.</li>
            <li>Try to refer to MP1, MP2, MP3, or other bounding boxes in the image via their tag (e.g. MP1) as often as you can.</li>
            <li>Please use the tags MP1, MP2, MP3 to refer to the people in the image. If the person you want to refer to is not a "main person", only then you can use a bounding box tag instead (e.g. 3).</li>
            <li>In the rare case that there are more than 3 main people in the image, pick 3 people to answer questions for.</li>
            <li>If something is hard to see (some images can be hectic), don't stress about labeling it. You only need to label the obvious people and obvious intent.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the detections may not include the main person. In this case, write n/a for the bounding box and continue to fill out captions for the main person.</li>
            <li>Please use the tags MP1, MP2, MP3 instead of the bounding box tags (e.g. do not say "3") whenever possible.</li>
            <li>If it does not seem like the edited image is similar to the origonal image, please treat the prompt as "why would someone make an image edit like this?" rather than "why would someone edit the source image like this?". Please don't skip the HIT!</li>
            <li>If the boxes are hard to tell or there are many boxes, just give your best guess. This will be fixed soon :)</li>
            <li>You should use descriptors that <span class="emph">uniquely describe this scene.</span></li>

                                <li>The important physical change in this image is that the gun MP1 is holding was turned into a banana.</li>

                                <li>Editor created this edit to <span class="response">trivialize MP1's work</span> <span class="rationale">by insinuating that he was a backup dancer for a pop musician.</span></li>
                                <li>Editor created this edit to <span class="response">make people laugh at MP1</span> <span class="rationale">for looking like a dancer instead of a leader.</span></li>
                                <li>MP1 would feel <span class="response">bewildered</span> <span class="rationale">as he knows he didn't dance in any music videos but was made to look like he was in one.</span></li>
                                <li>MP1 would feel <span class="response">self-conscious</span> <span class="rationale">because he wouldn't want people to think that he had participated in a dance music video.</span></li>
