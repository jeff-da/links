<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem a bit crazy because he looks like he is waving goodbye to some pyramids that are now flying into the sky via hidden thrusters on their  bottoms</p>
