<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel utterly confused because it looks like he is dressed in his normal clothes, yet he is wearing a costume mask that resembles the face of the fictional alien Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie and he is also holding a dog in his arms, yet this dog has the face of a man (or at least, is wearing a mask that is shaped like the face of a man who is wearing a dog mask)</p>

<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would be confused because even though he acted in movies alongside a man who dressed as Chewbacca, 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 himself does not recall ever putting on the costume, which in any case, appears to be much smaller than 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is used to seeing, because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's head seems abnormally huge by comparison</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to possibly create a work of postmodern art, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is wearing the costume of a fictional alien in the Star Wars movies, 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is only wearing the facial mask of this same costume, and a pet dog is wearing a mask that looks like 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 if he was wearing a dog mask, and none of this, to say the least, makes any sense</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to imply that hi-jinx ensued during the filming of the Star Wars movies, because the easily-recognizable actor 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appears to be wearing the costume of a furry co-star, 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 appears to be wearing the face mask of that same character, and a dog is wearing a mask that looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 if he was wearing a dog-shaped Halloween mask</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that two actors and a dog engaged in some costume-related games on the set of "The Empire Strikes Back" because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 are each wearing parts of the Chewbacca costume and that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has further decided to make a Halloween mask that looks like 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
's face if he was wearing a dog mask, and 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 decided to put this mask on a real dog</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 dressed up his dog for Halloween, because the dog appears to be wearing a mask that looks like a human face in a dog mask, and it also looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has borrowed a Chewbacca mask from his friend, 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 tried on a miniature version of the Chewbacca costume while filming the Star Wars movies, because it looks like the actor who played Han Solo is wearing the costume, even though 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
's head is abnormally large inside the suit</p>
