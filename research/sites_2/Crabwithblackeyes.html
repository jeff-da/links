<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make an unusual-looking crab appear to be the same species as the character Yoda from the Star-Wars universe, because the crab's face does not appear out of place on Yoda's body</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make people think that the baby Yoda character with the crab face was a real character in the Star-Wars films and TV shows, because it is dressed in a manner similar to that of other characters</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make people think that a real-world crustacean was the inspiration for either Yoda in two of the original Star-Wars movies, or for "the child" in a recent streaming series, because a crab's face looks remarkably like that of Yoda's species when it is placed on a character's body</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that there is a background character in a previously-released Star Wars feature that greatly resembles Yoda but with the face of a crab, because a crab's face is seen on the body of a character from the Star Wars universe</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that a real-life crab actually inspired the appearance of Yoda and his species in the Star Wars universe, because this crab's face looks natural on the body of a character that resembles Yoda</p>
