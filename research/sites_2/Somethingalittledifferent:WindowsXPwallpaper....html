<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to suggest a new desktop background for Microsoft PC users, because the familiar background from Windows has been replaced with an artistic night-time scene</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to offer an alternative to the classic Windows background, because it looks like there is now a more artistic, if ominous, night-time scene available</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that this is a real background image that is available on all Windows PCs because the scene greatly resembles the landscape from the classic windows background image</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that computer backgrounds actually change with the time of day, because the windows backdrop is now seen at night when a storm is gathering, but most people only know about the blue skies because they only use their PCs at work during the day</p>
