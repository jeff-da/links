<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look like he's let himself go, because it looks like he has let his eyebrows grow into a unibrow.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
