<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to show how, historically, MP1 wouldn't have even been allowed to stand in the bar depicted here, he would have been excluded due to Jim Crow laws in effect then (which forbid African Americans access to popular bars or any place whites were served), he could actually have been subject to arrest, physical, and verbal abuse.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to point out how, MP1 is a sort of man of the people, if you ignore the legal issues he would have faced here, he is seen as congenial, a regular guy. His easy manner, seen in the original and transposed to the edit, makes him, in deed, seem like the kind of guy you'd want to drink a beer with.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to highlight the fact that we still need to work on Civil Rights, improving laws to include fair treatment for African Americans, like MP1.</p>
