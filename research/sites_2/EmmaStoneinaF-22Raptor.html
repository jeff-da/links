<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be annoyed because it looks like she is wearing a lot of makeup and carrying donuts while she herself did neither of those things while sitting in the cockpit of a fighter jet</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to suggest that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has no business in the cockpit of a fighter jet, because it looks like she is wearing makeup and carrying donuts, which are things that a fighter pilot would not do</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look glamorous and capable of effortlessly flying an airplane, because she is wearing makeup, even when she is about to wear an oxygen mask, and it looks like she is so confident in her ability to fly that she is prepared to have a snack while operating the machine</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem unprofessional, because it looks like she is more concerned with her facial appearance and with eating sweets than she is with flying an airplane</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to suggest that women should not be pilots, because they are more concerned with sweets and cosmetics, as is 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, than they are with the complicated task of flying an airplane</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to suggest that women are capable of anything and everything, because it looks like a female fighter pilot is able to fly her plane so effortlessly that she can put some time into doing her makeup and can even eat a couple of donuts while flying</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that Emma Stone really did wear ostentatious makeup and eat a couple of donuts while posing with an F-22 fighter jet, because it looks like she is winking to the camera, revealing her purple eyeliner</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that women in the military are unreasonably concerned with food and with their appearances, because it looks like one fighter pilot, who resembles Emma Stone, has put on makeup prior to a flight and took a couple of donuts with her</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that women in the Air Force are even more capable than men, because they can fly their machines capably even after spending time to do their makeup so that they look like movie stars and even while eating snacks in the cockpit</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 actually wore ostentatious makeup and carried some baked goods with her while she flew a fighter jet, because she is seen in the cockpit wearing eyeliner, lipstick and nail polish and she has two donuts on her fingers</p>
