<p>Editor created this edit to draw attention to the crazy look of this person wearing IKEA bags, seeming to be in a costume or weird get up, just pointing similarities between the original character, placing him in a scene titled iKKKea, they mean it to be a sort of derivative sort of illustration.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to feature the sacks IKEA gives out for shoppers, pointing out their uses, and possible misuses in a whimsical, and unique way, like the edited IKKKea sign implies.</p>
