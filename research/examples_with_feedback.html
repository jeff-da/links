<h4>How might MP1 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp1_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 1]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP1 would feel angry seeing his image that was originally made during a serious, for him, event, which he takes as a sort of icon of some importance, he'd be upset to be so belittled.</p>

<p>MP1 would wonder why he's seen with a Verizon bill, he doesn't even use them as a carrier, he doesn't know anything about them, if he did, the image portrayed with the bill is inaccurate, he feels.</p>

<p>MP1 would think he's being mocked as an angry sort of white entitled guy who wants a lower bill for his cell phone, he would really feel bad about this.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about MP1?<mark>[dim: mp1_mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>
    Someone might mistakenly believe that MP1 hates the company Verizon, since they are holding the bill in a way that suggests anger and disgust. 
</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark>[dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to show how awful Verizon is, they take advantage and unnerve their customers, they are so bad they literally cause people to become almost insane, like MP1.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to Show how out of control MP1 seems, how crazy, nutty and weird, to be so upset over a Verizon bill seems out of control, this draws attention to that.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to detract from the cause MP1 really embraces, substituting minor consumer complaints with something he gets so crazy and so into, like protests and demonstrations.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark>[dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to highlight Verizon, their bills, and the poor service they have, making them an example the MP1 just seems to embrace and reflect.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to detract from the cause MP1 really embraces, making that cause seem crazy, like someone with a nutty look in their eyes embraces, by placing a sort of "bill" in his hands where he had nothing before it highlights that.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to juxtapose the world of political type protest with corporate greed, to wit, MP1 versus the Verizon Corporate bill many of us are forced to face whether we want to or not.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark>[dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>
    In regards to the edit as a whole (not just MP1/2/3), this edit might mislead someone into believing that the company Verizon makes their customers mad, since one of their customers seems to be very upset with his bill.

Also, you should have labeled both figures, since in the _edit_ (not org image) they are both important. You can give similar captions to both.

<h4><mark>feedback for above HIT (rating 3):</mark>The main point of the edit isn't just the age (which is good that you mentioned!), but also the fact way she's holding the flamethrower (which I would argue is more critical / why the person even thought of the edit in the first place). Think about what in the source image is important.

<h4><mark>feedback for above HIT (rating 3):</mark>You have some really good captions here (e.g. This edit could potentially be used to show that MP1 is a horrible human because he's happily holding up a sign about destruction.). But really, the main point of the edit isn't just making him seem like he did 911, since it's obvious that he didn't. It's just making him look ridiculous with that font and images.
