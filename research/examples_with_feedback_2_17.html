<h4>How might MP1 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp1_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 2]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP1 would feel so angry he might not be able to stand it, he'd feel slighted, mocked, and angry, the edit with him holding a tin can, feeling bad, with child's hands  would craze him into a tweet storm.</p>

<p>MP1 would be perplexed, the idea of tin cans with a string would seem silly, he probably never played much with others, this would be a new thing, for that to work, you'd have to have 2 willing players, he's not used to that, plus if he wanted a new phone then daddy would get one, toot sweet.</p>

<p>MP1 would wonder why he's drawn in the edit communicating with MP2, he only speaks when ordering them to dig up dirt, otherwise he's of no real use to him.</p>

<h4>How might MP2 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp2_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 1]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP2 would feel a little perplexed about being tied to MP1 at all, he'd be a little miffed possibly but mainly perplexed at the string cans, used for communication, first he'd wonder about an interpreter, Trump can't speak his language and almost no on can understand MP1.</p>

<p>MP2 would feel a little sad, been seen in the edit as a sort of child, begging MP1 to play, demeans him, it would make him feel bad.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark>[dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to mock MP1 and his complaint against poor treatment as the caption update mentioning poor treatment with the writing at top, this make MP1 seem petty, as they probably meant to.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to show how MP1 treats MP2, the sad horrible original image, replaced with some tin can toys and the writing makes it obvious.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark>[dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to draw attention to the Impeachement questions, pointing out the mess caused by MP1 and how threatening MP2 really sort of caused the whole thing, MP1's hiring of silly people only pointed this out greatly.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to discredit MP1 further, showing his petty meanness, overstatement of facts, and copying the lie he told in bold print above the edited image points this out.</p>

<h4><mark>[detection: box 1]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP1 would be angry at being made a fool of, he'd feel threatened and upset by seemingly being ganged up on by Americans, adding MP3 to the mix would unnerve him.</p>

<p>MP1 would feel like he doesn't quite understand by Biden would be important really at all, he'd feel puzzled, Biden isn't even one of the top nominee possibilites now so why is he here, supposedly there might be a Ukranian connection?</p>

<p>MP1 would feel like MP2 might be milking a sort of grudge against MP1, belittling him, lessening his stature, even actually looking down on him, now having his Veep poke him in the eye, as in the edited change.</p>

<h4>How might MP2 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp2_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 3]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP2 would would be confused, MP3 wasn't with him at this meeting, MP3 was elsewhere and he would never have acted like the edited version implies, sticking a finger in MP1's eye and towering over him.</p>

<p>MP2 would feel it might be just a little funny, seeing MP3 sort of poke MP1, because MP1 is so short tempered anyway, the idea is a little funny, the edited version with MP3 approaching him with a finger makes it even more hilarious.</p>

<h4>How might MP2 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp3_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 4]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP3 would think it might be a little funny, he'd be a little giddy, feeling happy putting it to MP1, poking him, as the edit suggests, He'd get a little giggle feeling happy.</p>

<p>MP3 would feel worried that MP1 might prove more prickly to the United States, damaging relations further, he might worry the edited image might get out.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark>[dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to imply a connection of some sort to MP1 linking them in some way, editing the poking MP3, might imply something like a connection the edited added MP3 poking belies this.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to torture MP1, showing him as dominated by MP3 and MP2, depicting a weakness there, the edited image implies that.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark>[dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to show MP3 as being anti MP1, showing how much he dislikes him, would want to physically poke him as in the edited image of him poking MP1 there.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make people laugh by showing how feminine and furious MP1 looks.</p>

<h4><mark>feedback for above HIT (rating 3):</mark>For Prompt 7 (the last one), you shouldn't write about MP1, since you can just write that caption in Prompt 2 2/2.

<h4><mark>feedback for above HIT (rating 3):</mark>"Confused" because he sat next to a lego man isn't a great caption - you were a little off here, since this image is "normalizing" talking to lego men by making other celeberties sit next to lego men.

<h4>How might MP1 feel after seeing this edit?<mark>[dim: mp1_effects]</mark></h4> 

<h4><mark>[detection: box 1]</mark></h4> 

<p>MP1 would feel amused because it looks like they were flying like Mary Poppins (a well known disney character that is often in this situation)</p>

<p>MP1 would feel confused as he would likely not remember when he was in such a situation or even when he had his umbrella open</p>

<p>MP1 would feel astonished as he likely would not know that such an edit would even be possible, but the background and situation makes it obviously false.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark>[dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make light of an unfortunate situation being a rainy day and umbrella mishap to make it look like MP1 could fly</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to portray MP1 in a fun scenario as they are usually portrayed in very serious situations</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark>[dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to spread rumors about MP1 that they travel via umbrella across the sky</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to suggest that MP1 is similar to a disney character and not as serious as people take them</p>

<h4><mark>feedback for above HIT (rating 4):</mark>I think the caption regarding being confused didn't need to be there - it isn't adding much to your analysis. But your captions are generally good! Also, for Prompt 7, you shouldn't mention MP1, since you can just do this in Prompt 2 (2/2) instead.

<h4><mark>feedback for above HIT (rating 4):</mark>Here, I don't think people would think MP1 is an inept president. He just can't use a camera. In general, try not to "force" explainations.

<p>MP1 would he enraged  because it portrays him as someone who would shop at Claire's, a store frequented by soft feminine people,  by putting him inside the store and making him look like he's browsing.</p>

<p>MP1 would feel disgraced because he works to maintain a strong appearance, and browsing at a store like Claire's (which is aimed at children) makes him seem feminine and childlike.</p>

<p>MP1 would feel insulted, as the store he is shown browsing is full of colorful children's accessories--making him look like he's someone who enjoys wearing and buying those items instead of like a world leader.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark>[dim: intent]</mark></h4>

<p>Editor created this edit to make fun of MP1, as he's someone who takes his reputation very seriously and being shown in a children's fashion store would make him easy to mock.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark>[dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make MP1 seem like a childish feminine person because he is shown browsing a children's fashion store called Claire's.</p>

<h4><mark>feedback for above HIT (rating 4):</mark>Your captions are great! I looked through several of your responses. In general, I think you use too many captions, although your captions are good - many of your captions just talk about him being childlike, although I actually don't know if I'm right here, since your captions are pretty good - just something to keep in mind (that you don't need to fill out all 3 captions). More importantly, when filling out prompt 7, you shouldn't talk about MP1, since you can talk about that in Prompt 2 (2/2).

<p>MP1 would feel confused, because he would know that he had not recently flown a helicopter over a war.</p>
