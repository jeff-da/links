I get why these stay up for a bit.  I'm not sure I even did this correctly; it seems to incredibly redundant.  I mean, for this one, how many things can you say about a swap like this?  On a technical note, the caption boxes are too short. See how long this optional feedback input is? Why can't the caption boxes be the same length? I know you're just reusing Rowan's template, but for those of us on a desktop, with a wide screen monitor, you're literally leaving 25% unused, which adds to the difficulty of doing this, because the images are off the screen, requiring constant scrolling back and forth to see while typing --- an issue the would be mitigated if you used the complete horizontal space.  (See attached screenshot¹)Of course, this assumes that whomever (grad student) at xlab is running this particular hit actually gives a hoot about this feedback... given how awesome people like Ari and Max are there, it stands to reason that there'd be the opposite - people that aren't really as concerned about this side of things.Augh. And trying to submit this stupid thing, error messages² that are useless. Doesn't say how long they need to be; even trying to pad out, still there. Incredibly frustrating. Unnecessarily so.Great. Let's see... 48 minutes on this task now? This is awesome stuff. Let's see why your code's messed up. So, you're checking if len0 and len1 are less than 110. Fair enough. What am I at? 120 and 125, for those, now that I've added padding words. And yet, I can't submit. (Doesn't seem like your input propertychange is working)$(""#intent_1"").val().length  is 100, which isn't < 90.$(""#implications_1"").val().length is 119, which isn't < 100.$(""#mp1_feel_0"").val().length is 125, which isn't < 85$(""#mp2_feel_0"").val().length  is 116 which isn't < 85$(""#mp3_feel_0"").val().length  is 10. Ah-ha.  Wait, no... there is no mp3, and that's checked.  Are... are you not checking to also make sure? Why, it doesn't look like you are... You're just comparing the length and not taking into account the checkbox that says there isn't an MP3?  Bollocks. Well, at least you had the decency not to wrap everything in an anonymous function. Let's see if we can set ""isGood"" to true to get this bloody thing to submit, so I can go caress a fish in alcohol to repress having wasted so much time on this.¹ https://gyazo.com/884945a3cb554e6f6e70f1e1ceaa5af6² https://gyazo.com/54f9717b09c87bd1e6b867457249f52a","This edit could potentially be used to humiliate MP1 because it makes it look like MP1 is getting it on with a fish.","This edit could potentially be used to enrage MP1 because MP1 would consider caressing a fish insulting to his dignity.","This edit could potentially be used to insult MP1 by presenting him as a drop-in replacement for another politician notorious for being partisan and controversial.","Editor created this edit to try to mock MP1 by presenting him holding a very large fish, which is a silly thing for a serious person to be doing.","Editor created this edit to make MP1 seem to be interchangeable with the real British head of state.","Editor created this edit to imply there is something altogether fishy about MP1 by having him appear to rub a fish on his face.","1","MP1 would feel disgusted because it would look like they're being a bit amorous with a fish which is a very insulting thing.","MP1 would feel pissed because it implies there's something fishy about him and his policies, which would attack his ego.","MP1 would feel outraged that he's being substituted for a British politician that he doesn't see himself being anything like at all.","","y","2","MP2 would be appalled to be featured holding fish with a foreign head of state who hasn't ever met and may not like.","MP2 would be baffled to be kissing fish with a head of state he's never met as it would be the sort of thing he'd surely remember.","MP2 would furious his meeting with the current prime minister of his country was mocked by swapping the PM for some other country's head.","ye","{}","MP3 would","MP3 would","MP3 would","","n","y"
