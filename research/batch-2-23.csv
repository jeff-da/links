In this case, Trump and the pitcher wearing the MAGA hat are bounded by the single box, MP1, so how to fill out the second MP annotation is not really clear. I just put in 1 for the MP2's box number and also ticked on box missing.  I could've put in n/a and only do the MP1, but that doesn't seem right.  I wasn't sure because MP1 IS ""detected"" correctly, and both Trump and the pitcher were in the box ""completely,"" so either could've been MP1. And This hit could really use a better navigable interface. I just got a bunch of warnings about the character length,s when I already put in the rationales for all the annotations. But the warnings only give Prompt numbers like, ""Prompt 1, caption 3 is a little shorter than we would expect (at least 21 more characters). Please make sure you included a rationale."" But the prompt 1 is only has one caption. Then ""Prompt 2, caption 1 is a little shorter than we would expect (at least 11 more characters). Please make sure you included a rationale."" But the prompt 2 has two parts, which one is the one with shorter annotation? I've managed to change the part annotation to a longer version. It would help a lot if the boxes show character numbers and the require or suggested number of characters (i think there are ways to implement that in this mturk Interface)Very confusing.
