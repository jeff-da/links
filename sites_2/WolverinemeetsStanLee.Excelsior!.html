<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would feel playful because it would be silly that such a small change was done but it represents humor and unity that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 shares with his fans at the same time</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would feel excited that someone thought to put this odd air of mystery into the image even though it was where 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 met a fan at</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 appear to look like the other person because the same exact mask has been put over 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
s own head and he is smiling through it</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 seem like an even greater creator because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is sharing in the creative art of his fans by wearing the items he is given out of joy</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that Stan Lee enjoys getting gifts from his fan since the mask is identical to the fans mask it would be assumed that the fan gave it to him and asked for a picture with them both wearing it</p>

<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 was given a gift because the mask worn by 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is the same one that the other person has and would have likely been made especially for 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>

<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel amazed because his jaw was shaved before the editor awarded him beards because the editor thought 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 never grew beards</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to show the elderly to always keep beards to show superiority because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seems to be superior with the beards on</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to show how shabby 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would look with beards because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is always shaving and no one gets to see 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 with beards</p>
