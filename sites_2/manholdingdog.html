<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make it look like simba poops because rafiki is following the signs orders and mimicking the man who is holding up his dog because it poops</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to make the dog look like simba because the man is holding up the dog on pride rock much like simba is held up to the rest of the animal kingdom in the movie</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to further a joke because it makes it look like simba is also being held up in the air because he poops much like the sign suggests</p>
