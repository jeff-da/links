<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel powerful because it looks like they are ready to prepare for a viking battle and ready to fight since 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is holding onto a shield.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel famous because it looks like they are in a popular movie about vikings and it appears that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is the main character because he is front and center.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel like a strong leader because it looks like they might be leading a battle in a movie since they appear to be the oldest and therefore, the most experienced of all of the movie characters.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look like actor from a popular movie with a big role about vikings because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has viking gear on and the word vikings is shown so it looks like an ad for the movie with a close up of characters and a digitally edited background.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look more in place with society based on his fashion choices because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 had a funny hat so the editor wanted to portray 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 as a viking.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem out of place because others around 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 are young and fit and appear determined while 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 has a look of worry.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is a famous but bad actor, since 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is shown on a movie poster with a puzzled look while everyone else looks fit and professional and prepared for their roles, but 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 does not appear to fit in.</p>
