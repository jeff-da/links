<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel a little silly, not understanding that he's sort of being mocked in a superimposed image, like the time he sat on a train, spreading widely.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel ok, maybe imaging that he's being sort of deified here, like a sort of god, in a church, he's used to that sort of, having everyone fawn, cower in fear, everything, he's seen it all.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to Show that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is a sort of good sport, seeming to take place in old art, while wearing cook kicks.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to demean 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, showing how fat, unfit, silly and inept he is, this could hold him up against a sort of ideal model, side by side.</p>
