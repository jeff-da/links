<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to highlight the similarity between natural phenomena like the scales of an alligator and human-made inventions like boot treat by making it look like the scales are a footprint on the moon.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make it seem like there's a possibility that photos from moonwalks could be fakes because it looks like the footprint left behind an astronaut is actually alligator scales, when examined close up.</p>
