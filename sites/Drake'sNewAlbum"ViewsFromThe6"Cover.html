<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel confused because it looks like he has climbed to the top of what appears to be Toronto's CN tower, but 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 could not recall ever climbing this structure, or possibly even visiting the city</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel triumphant because it looks like he is fearlessly perched on the edge of a tower's wall while he himself is making a confident gesture</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to be confident and fearless, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is sitting comfortably at the top of a very tall tower</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem like a rap musician, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is sitting fearlessly at the top of a tall tower, while making a confident gesture similar to those often made by hip-hop artists, all while a small label warns the viewer about explicit lyrics</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that Toronto's CN Tower was used as the setting for a rap album cover, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is sitting fearlessly on the edge of a wall near the top of the tower, and a warning label about explicit lyrics can also be seen far below 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's figure</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that another artist made and released an album that is a parody of Drake's "Views" because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, who clearly does not resemble Drake, appears to be seated in the same location and in a similar stance on 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's own album cover</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 climbed to the top of a very tall tower and confidently sat on a wall without any safety railings, perhaps while intending to use the image as an album cover, because a small label warning about explicit lyrics can be seen far below this depiction of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to show how busy the balcony of a ship can be because people can be seen sitted at the balcony of the ship</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make fun of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
  because they are depicting him as a monkey which is a common way to insult someone because we evolved from monkeys</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to imply that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is less evolved than other humans because they are being depicted as a monkey which is the lesser form of human evolution</p>
