<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would be confused because it looks like

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that one of this woman's students was both an incompetent artist and a lecherous man because he has merely drawn her in stick-figure form, and yet he has badly overestimated the size of her breasts</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that this same student was having impure thoughts about this long-suffering model, because he has drawn her with her mouth wide open, as if he was imagining the act of fellatio</p>

 is quite unimpressive when viewed from the front, because it looks like one of her students is not attempting to draw her figure, and instead has imagined a much-more buxom woman which he has now attempted to draw.  This has attracted the disapproving glance of a man standing next to him.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is modeling for a group of incompetent artists, because it looks like one has merely drawn a crude stick figure when attempting to capture her form, and at least one other student has actually splattered paint onto

's body</p>
