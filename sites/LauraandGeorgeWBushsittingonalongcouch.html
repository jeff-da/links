<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 has chosen to sit so far away from him instead of sitting right next to him.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would like he has to yell to talk to

<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
.</p>

<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel like the edit, showing him on a teeter totter is silly, just a bit of merriment, it draws attention to an earlier silly photo with him and 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
, where he was also on a long red couch, rather than the red TeeterTotter, now found.</p>

<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would also think this is silly, showing her playing on a child's teeter totter with her husband, 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, she probably wouldn't really be upset much, she has a fair sense of self and humor.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to draw attention to the oddness of the original photo, which displayed 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 and 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 on a ridiculously long couch, I imagine it was their idea or agreed term to sit upon it in this manner, so the teeter totter is apt and cute.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to show a bit of mirth, I don't think it could represent anything except a sort of silliness by a former president and first lady, nothing serious.</p>

 appear to be a shy guy at a dance because he is sitting alone looking over at a girl in a dance party.</p>
