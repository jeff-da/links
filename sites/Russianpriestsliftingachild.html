<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make it look like mermaid children are real because there are people pulling a child with a fish tail out of the water.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make people think that a long time ago mermaids existed because the photo looks very old, black and white, and has a group of people pulling a child out of the water who has a tail.</p>
