<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel epic because it looks like he is one of the main characters in a video game since he is standing opposite his opponent posed for a battle</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel mocked since his religious crucifix is being portrayed as a weapon due to the way he is holding it above his head in an almost threatening manner</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear as a character in a video game because the background and the health bars look almost exactly like the video game mortal combat.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem like a villian because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is in the video game holding up the cross in a violent manner, similar to an evil villian</p>
