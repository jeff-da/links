 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel agitated because people might see 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appearing to have poor manners and a lack of respect by having 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's mouth stuffed with food at an important ceremony.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel bitter animosity because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is being portrayed in a non complimentary fashion by having the huge burrito shown in MP's mouth at what should be a proud and serious ceremony.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to humiliate 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 for 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's insinuation that the ceremony was boring  by 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 yawning because the giant burrito shown in 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's mouth covered up the insulting yawn.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to impede 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's future educational goals because it portrays 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 as having a lack of respect for education by showing 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's inappropriate burrito eating at an important educational ceremony which would cause serious colleges to dismiss 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 as a good candidate for their college.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to embarrass 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 because it could be shown to people who know 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 but did not attend the ceremony and cause them to think 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 did not know how to act at a graduation ceremony.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that this generation of kids lacks respect and appreciation for tradition and authority because of the rude, disrespectful and inappropriate behavior shown by 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 crudely having a giant burrito stuffed in 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's mouth during graduation.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is disrespectful and nonconforming because eating food during a ceremony is disrespectful in itself but obviously flaunting a lack of manners and etiquette take it to a higher level of disrespect.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is thoughtless and inconsiderate towards 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's fellow classmates because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is acting inappropriately by not only eating but eating in a crude manner and ruining the atmosphere and ambiance of the ceremony for 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's peers.</p>
