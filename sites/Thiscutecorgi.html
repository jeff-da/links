<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make the wide opened mouth of the dog look like a play slider because the dog's mouth was opened wide.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to show a new design for a swing because using a dog's mouth as the output point is a good plot</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make children fearless because when children play from the dog's mouth they tend to fear dogs less.</p>
