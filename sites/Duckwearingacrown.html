<p>This edit could potentially be used to make the duck look like he is king of the rails because he has been placed on the subway train with his crown and kingdom and is proudly surveying his area</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that someone brought a duck onto the subway because he is seated in several empty seats with a woman look down in a disgusted manner at the sight of the duck</p>
