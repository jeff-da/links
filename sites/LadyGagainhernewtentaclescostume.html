<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel surprised because it looks like they put her under the sea and put her with another sea creature.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel pleased because it looks like they put her in an environment that matches her costume.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear as a sea creature because she's wearing a tentacle costume and that fits in with the under the sea theme used in the edited surroundings.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to be a sea creature because 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 looks like a sea creature from this angle and she's placed under the sea with a actual sea creature.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that Lady Gaga is actually a sea creature because the image under the sea looks like she's a squid or an octopus and the camera GUI and the filter make it appear that she's actually under the sea.</p>
