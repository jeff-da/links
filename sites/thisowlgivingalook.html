<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make the owl look like a biker because it is on the back seat with another biker and they are driving down the road together</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to promote motorcycle safety because the owl and man are both riding down the road on a motorcycle but only the man is secure and wearing a helmet</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make the owl seem tough because it continues to give a sassy look to the camera as it drives down the road on the back of a motorcycle</p>
