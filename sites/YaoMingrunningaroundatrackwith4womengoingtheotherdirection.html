 would feel amused because it looks like he has very tiny versions of himself trying to follow him around</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to poke fun at how large 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is because the women running in the other direction were half his size and edited to look like

</p>

<h4>How might

 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 5]</mark>
 would feel scared because he recognizes the track yet he is now seeing an enormous human hand coming down from the sky, which four women apparently are not concerned about</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make people laugh at 
<mark>[person in box 5]</mark>
's unusually tall stature, as if women at the track would not notice a giant hand after they saw 
<mark>[person in box 5]</mark>
</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to imply that some kind of giant creature has come to a track where 
<mark>[person in box 5]</mark>
 once ran, because an enormous hand is stalking the track, disguised as a jogger</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to simply make people laugh at 
<mark>[person in box 5]</mark>
's tall stature because two fingers wearing miniature shorts and sneakers would not look much more outrageous</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that fellow athletes had grown so accustomed to Yao Ming's tall stature that they did not notice when a giant's hand began stalking them at the track.  They merely assumed that the fingers were just Ming's very long legs.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about

?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 5]</mark>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 5]</mark>
 had been captured by a giant, who stole some of his clothes to that its hand could blend in at a jogging track and possibly kidnap four young women</p>

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim:
