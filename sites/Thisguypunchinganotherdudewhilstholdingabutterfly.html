<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would feel powerful because it looks like he is delivering a knockout blow to another 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
, possibly because that man insulted 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
's butterly-man figurine</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would feel ashamed, because it looks like he is physically assaulting 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 on the street while others look on, and 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 himself is actually wearing a t-shirt that, though obscured, appears to feature Martin Luther King's face, prison number, and part of the reverand's famous declaration, which suggests that 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 would not consider violence to be acceptable</p>

<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would be embarrassed because it looks not only like 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is being knocked out by 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
, but that 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 is holding onto a butterfly-man figurine while he delivers a punch, which not only adds to 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
's humiliation but also gives the impression that 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 was so confident in his ability to defeat 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 that 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 could literally do it one-handed</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would be confused, and possibly worried about a lingering head injury, because, while he could distinctly remember losing a fight to 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
, he could not recall anything about a butterfly-man figurine</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 appear to be strong and capable of defending himself yet also very proud of his strangely effeminate figurine that depicts a man with butterfly wings, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 is assaulting 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 while holding onto that figurine</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to make it look like 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 had insulted 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
's butterfly-man figurine, because it looks like the man holding the figurine is now delivering a savage punch to 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
's face, while the other onlookers do not appear to be angry at 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 seem like someone who would defend his property against anyone who either threatens or insults it, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 is punching 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 while he himself carefully holds onto a figurine of a man with butterfly wings</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that followers of Dr. Martin Luther King, who normally espouse non-violence, may come to blows with strangers who insult their treasured figurines, because it looks like a man wearing a t-shirt with MLK's image on it is punching a man while proudly holding onto a figurine that depicts a man wearing butterfly wings even as other men who are not wearing MLK attire or holding figurines simply look on with indifference</p>

 was carrying a figurine in the shape of a man with butterfly wings when, for one reason or another,

 got into a physical altercation in which he easily prevailed over 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
</p>
