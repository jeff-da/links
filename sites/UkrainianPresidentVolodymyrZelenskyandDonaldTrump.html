<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would feel so angry he might not be able to stand it, he'd feel slighted, mocked, and angry, the edit with him holding a tin can, feeling bad, with child's hands  would craze him into a tweet storm.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would be perplexed, the idea of tin cans with a string would seem silly, he probably never played much with others, this would be a new thing, for that to work, you'd have to have 2 willing players, he's not used to that, plus if he wanted a new phone then daddy would get one, toot sweet.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would wonder why he's drawn in the edit communicating with 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, he only speaks when ordering them to dig up dirt, otherwise he's of no real use to him.</p>

<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel a little perplexed about being tied to 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 at all, he'd be a little miffed possibly but mainly perplexed at the string cans, used for communication, first he'd wonder about an interpreter, Trump can't speak his language and almost no on can understand 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
.</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel a little sad, been seen in the edit as a sort of child, begging 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 to play, demeans him, it would make him feel bad.</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to mock 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and his complaint against poor treatment as the caption update mentioning poor treatment with the writing at top, this make 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 seem petty, as they probably meant to.</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to show how 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 treats 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, the sad horrible original image, replaced with some tin can toys and the writing makes it obvious.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to draw attention to the Impeachement questions, pointing out the mess caused by 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 and how threatening 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 really sort of caused the whole thing, 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
's hiring of silly people only pointed this out greatly.</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to discredit 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 further, showing his petty meanness, overstatement of facts, and copying the lie he told in bold print above the edited image points this out.</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is vastly incompetent, this is probably not true, his needing help from 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 shouldn't be something that demeans him, he's helping his Ukranian people.</p>

<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 really has been abused or "treated so badly", no other president has espoused so much hate and gotten away with so much as he has.</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 has much connection to 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, there is little, only when 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 inserts himself in bullying for dirt, otherwise, they communicate not at all.</p>
