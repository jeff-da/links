 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be confused since he has probably never been on a skateboard before doing things that are depicted in the edited photograph</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look like he is getting mad air because he has taken off from the side of the skate park wall and is currently in mid-flight over another park goer of the same nationality</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem like he is just a skater because everything in the image only leaves it to your imagination that he is skating and nothing else</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that the protestor actually just skates because he has had his entire image taken out of the protest area and placed into a skatepark scene</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is a skateboarder because everything about the original photo has been edited out except for certain parts of his body which are shown in a skateboarding trick pose now</p>
