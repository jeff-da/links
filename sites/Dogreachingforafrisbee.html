<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make it look like there's a new Tron movie coming out featuring a dog because the title in the image reads 'Tron: Fetch' and the dog seems to be trying to get an illuminated disk.</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make people think that the dog is an actor in the Tron films since he's on the front of what looks like a movie poster for "Tron: Fetch"</p>
