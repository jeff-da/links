<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make everyone appear to be the little girl because all the faces of the people in the scene have been changed to match the girl on the grounds face exactly</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to create a shock factor because you would not expect to see this small childs face on every single person that is in this photo</p>
