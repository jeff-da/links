 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel confused, because he does not recall ever giving a speech next to a man in a red tracksuit and he also does not understand how a cartoon-style speech bubble appeared in a photograph of himself</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be angry, because it looks like he has allowed a rebellious citizen to disrupt one of his speeches by holding up a sign next to the podium</p>

<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would be proud because it looks like he was courageous enough to take to the stage and interrupt a speech being given by 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
, a powerful dictator</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear to be whimsical and ineffectual because it looks like he felt the need to give a speech about the proper pronunciation of "gif", and yet even then he was interrupted by protesters</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make people think that the pronunciation "jif" is highly problematic, because it looks like a brutal dictator is calling for its use, and a young, hip protester is rebutting this point</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that Vladimir Putin actually gave a speech in which he decreed that the word "gif" should be pronounced 'jif', but a young protester in a red suit interrupted this speech by holding up a sign saying "No"</p>

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that the pronunciation "jif" is preferred by dictators, because Putin is seen calling for its use, and that young people should stick to the hard-g pronunciation to avoid supporting dictators because a young protester is speaking out against Putin</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 actually gave a speech, the words of which were somehow visible on camera, regarding the proper pronunciation of the word "gif", since this is what is ostensibly being said in the speech bubble</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 actually allowed a young rabble-rouser to rebut his key point, because 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 is visible to the right of the podium holding up a cardboard sign bearing the word "No"</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 actually had the opportunity, and the courage, to disrupt a speech being given by 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 so that 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 could personally rebut the world leader's pronouncement about the word "gif"</p>
