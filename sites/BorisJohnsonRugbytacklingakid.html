<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be interested since he is probably unfamiliar with an old movie like National Lampoons and might wonder why he is being shown clutching onto a strange man surrounded by women</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look like another person clinging to the main character because one of the posters themes is the women holding onto him and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is now also attached to his torso</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem like a fan of the Lampoon series since 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is now shown to be physically imposed onto the poster itself as someone who loves the main character</p>
