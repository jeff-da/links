<h4>How might

 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel proud because it looks like he is carrying a very similar prop to the one that he used at a campaign event, and that this may be more publicity for his campaign</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to simply make an artistic statement because a smaller image of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 holding a big dollar bill has been inserted into the original dollar bill</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem a little bit sloppy because it looks like he tried to create an inception-style image of himself holding up a giant dollar bill, but forgot to complete the image by adding more layers</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that the giant thousand-dollar bill that Andrew Yang used as a campaign prop actually contained a smaller image of Yang holding up the same prop because that image appears where a portrait of a founding-father would be found on real American currency</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 held up a giant dollar bill that contained a smaller picture of himself holding up the same giant dollar bill because that is what it looks like he is holding</p>
