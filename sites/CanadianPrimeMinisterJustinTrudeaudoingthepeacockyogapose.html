<p>

 would feel some amusement, because it looks like his facial structure really resembles that of the crudely-drawn Canadian characters in a once-popular American television series where the top of his head is physically disconnected from the neck and lower jaw</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4>

<mark>[person in box 3]</mark>
 and some of his colleagues have facial deformities that cause their heads to separate from their lower jaws</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that all Canadians, up to and including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, do indeed display the kind of strange anatomy on display in "South Park" where the tops of their heads float disconnected from their lower jaws when they talk.</p>

 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would be somewhat amused by how much the man in the white shirt looks like him, because man in the lake has very similar appearance and clothing and also appears to be coincidentally mimicking a yoga pose that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 knows well</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>

 might wear to the office, while dancing and/or working out in the middle of a lake</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4>
