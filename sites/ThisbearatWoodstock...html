<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to remind people of co-existence with nature because the villagers are simply letting the bear join in with their rituals as though it is one of the people</p>
