 would feel confused because it looks like he and 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 were actually present at the 1989 protests in Tiananmen square, where they both ran away from Chinese tanks, yet 
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 cannot recall ever visiting China and is far too young to have been there during that event</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 2]</mark>
 would feel confident and capable, because it looks like he is fearlessly crossing a street in front of a column of tanks, and a New Yorker such as himself wouldn't let any vehicle stop him from getting to his destination</p>
