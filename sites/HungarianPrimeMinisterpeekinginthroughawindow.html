<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to make it look like a real house with real human inhabitants exists inside of a video game, because the view outside the window depicts an angular, computer-generated landscape</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to imply that there is a part of the Earth that actually looks like the landscapes inside the video game Minecraft, at least when viewed from a distance, because the view outside of this house's windows is indistinguishable from the blocky landscapes in the game</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that there is a landscape somewhere in the world that looks like a Minecraft setting if one views it from far away, because the house shown here has a view of just such a landscape</p>
