<h4>How might 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 feel after seeing this edit?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 effects]</mark></h4> 

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel accomplished because it looks like her famous image is being used to promote games for children, who may later become fans of her music</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel self-conscious because, even though 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is never shy about dressing in provocative fashion, it looks like she is wearing a skimpy top, short skirt, and high heels that would all be considered inappropriate for a product marketed to children</p>

<p>
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 would feel embarrassed and uncomfortable because it looks like she is sliding down a chute while impractically dressed, and indeed a little blond-haired boy is actually covering his eyes (either in disgust or in shame) after looking up 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's skirt as she slid down the chute and another boy is actually unconsciously sticking out his tongue, as if he is anticipating his own glance at 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 in a compromised position</p>

<h4>Why did Editor create this edit?<mark> [dim: intent]</mark></h4> 

<p>Editor created this edit to appear playful and young-at-heart because it looks like she cannot resist the opportunity to try out some playground attractions, even when 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is clearly not dressed appropriately for physical activity</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 appear irresponsible and inappropriate around children, because it looks like she is deliberately sliding down a playground chute in a miniskirt without being concerned with exposing herself to minors</p>

<p>Editor created this edit to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 look like she simply posed for a photo in one of her favorite outfits but that this had an unfortunate outcome because it looks like her image is being used to sell children's games, even though her manner of dress and her pose are inappropriate for such a purpose</p>

<h4>What are the possible implications of this edit?<mark> [dim: implications]</mark></h4> 

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem like a playful, jovial soul who likes spending time with children, because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 could not resist joining some kids on a playground even though she was dressed in an impractical manner</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to make 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 seem like a potential deviant who likes to attract the gaze of children because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 is climbing and sliding on playground equipment while dressed in a skimpy top and miniskirt which would inevitably reveal a lot of her body to onlookers</p>

<p>This edit could potentially be used to imply that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 posed for photos in one of her favorite outfits, but that this image was used without her knowledge to sell children's games because it looks like her clothes are far too revealing for any physical activity, let alone any involving kids</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead the viewer?<mark> [dim: disinfo]</mark></h4> 

<p>In regards to the edit as a whole, this edit might mislead someone into believing that a chutes and ladders game used an image of 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 on the box, but this led to unfortunate implications because it looks like 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
's outfit is so revealing that she would inevitably expose herself to her companions if she actually played on a slide in that top and skirt</p>

<h4>How might this edit mislead someone to believe something untrue about 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
?<mark> [dim: 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 mislead]</mark></h4> 

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 posed on a playground slide so that her image could be used to sell children's chutes-and-ladders games, because she is now seen on the box sliding down one of the chutes while children play around her</p>

<p>Someone might mistakenly believe that 
<mark>[person in box 1]</mark>
 dressed in an eye-catching yet wholly-inappropriate fashion for her photo shoot because it looks like her clothing is far too revealing to be worn while climbing and sliding on playground equipment</p>
